# InterviewBox

TokBox coding exercise.

Progress tracking in docs/log.md.

## The Task

> Hi Valery,
>  
> I really enjoyed chatting with you and I wanted to follow up with the coding exercise we talked about.
> I would basically like to get an idea for your style as a developer and give you the opportunity to
> familiarise yourself with the OpenTok API. I don't expect you to spend days or weeks building something
> perfectly polished but rather just wanted you to spend a few hours to hack something together.
> The project itself is quite open ended but here are some possible ideas:
>  
> 1. An application for interviewing people. It could include videochat obviously,
>    but also potentially document sharing like Google Docs or possibly a mashup with a screen sharing service
>    like Yuuguu. We could then use the application ourselves to go over the code together.
> 2. An app that looks like Google+ hangouts where you can select a person to be the main presenter
>    and everyone else sits at the bottom.
> 3. An app like chatroulette for speed dating.
> 4. Some other idea of yours....
>  
> Feel free to use whatever languages you want, we have a JavaScript API and an ActionScript 3 API.
> We have server-side libraries in Ruby, Python, Java, Node.js, PHP and .NET.
> You can get started and register for an API key here.
>  
> When assessing the application I will be looking at coding style, efficiency and attention to detail as well
> as understanding of the API (don't want to see you just copy and pasting a sample app) and overall
> usability of what you create. I would basically like to see good/clear structure and use of objects. 
>  
> Let me know if you have any questions, I'm happy to be your own personal support while you build this app.
> It would be great if you could get something back to us after this weekend.
> Let me know if you don't think this will be possible.
>  
> Thanks, I look forward to seeing what you create!
>  
> Adam
