# InterviewBox

A small application for interviewing web developers online.

Implemented using OpenTok API, Node.js, Sockets.io, CodeMirror and Twitter Bootstrap.

Progress tracking in docs/log.md.

## Notes

http://www.tokbox.com/opentok/api/documentation/gettingstarted -
need to be updated - TB.initPublisher() takes element's id as the second param
but not as the fist one.
